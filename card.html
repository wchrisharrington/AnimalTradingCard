			<p>Peregrine falcons can be found world wide, with a breeding range that includes land regions from the Arctic tundra to the tropics.
				 Because of their fantastic hunting skills, they are a very popular bird used in falconry. Peregrines hunt primarily other birds, 
				 which they catch by diving at speeds over 200 miles per hour! </p>
